# Dataset-JSON from Define.xml and SAS datasets

## Description

The main purpose is to create Dataset-JSON files using SAS Procedure XSL to create SAS code using a XSL stylesheet (Dataset-JSON.xsl) from a Define.xml file.

The stylesheet is located in "Stylesheet" folder of this directory. A sample SAS program called "Dataset-JSON.sas" is available in the "Examples" folder. You'll need to update the placeholders <Your path> for the program to execute properly. Also available in this folder are sub-folders with dummy define files and their associated SAS datasets.

The stylesheet is compatible for both Define 2.0 and 2.1 versions.

This is a first draft version and comments are welcomed.
